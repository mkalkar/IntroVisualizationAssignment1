    <h2> Good visualization: </h2>

        <p>This is a visual that I have seen a lot throughout the pandemic. I appreciate how I can understand the deadly nature of covid through a visual. A lot of times I can’t quite comprehend the impact disease has had, until I look at data like this that compares diseases and their impact to each other. I think that the timeline is excellent as well. I like how I can easily see the diseases, when they took place, and the impact they had based on the size of the ball. This visualization has taught me a lot and I think it’s overall really great at displaying its intended information.</p>
    <h2> Bad visualization: </h2>

      <p>I think that this visualization does a pretty terrible job of displaying its information. First of all, there is no visualization aspect to the actual data. I can’t understand how well each of the cities did, unless I look at the numbers. The whole point of a visualization is to draw conclusions based off of a visual, not just the data. It took me longer to analyze it because of this. Additionally, I think that the different buildings related to each city confuses the intended audience. It feels like Mumbai should have the best batting average because the building is the tallest in the visual. This however, is not the case.  </p>
    <h2> Recreation of Bad Visualization </h2>

      <p>I think that my new visualization easily shows the trends from city to city of batting average and total runs in cricket. You can look at the data and clearly see who has the highest avg, and who has the lowest. There’s no need to look at the numbers unless you’re looking for specifics. This is much simpler and gets the point across.</p>
